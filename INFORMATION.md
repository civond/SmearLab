# SmearLab
This is the semi-official GitHub page for SmearLab. This is a nice way to keep our code organized and accessible. More importantly, it can let us double check each other's work before committing new changes (to avoid horrible mistakes). <br>
Please upload all code directly to this! <br><br>
